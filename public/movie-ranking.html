<h2>The Top 3 Best Movies According to James Morgan</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Wicked (2024)</h3>

<p>The music is masterfully composed and orchestrated, and it mixes lore from
    the original movie/book "The Wizard of Oz" with the
    adapted for stage book by Gregory McGuire entitled "Wicked: The Life and
    Times of the Wicked Witch of the West."</p>
<p>Also to mention are the performances of both Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo
    as Glinda and Elphaba.
    These women have an on-screen chemistry that's amazing - they really do look
    like best friends because
    they became that during filming! I've watched many interviews and
    behind-the-scenes featurettes for
    the movie, and I can tell that this film was definitely a passion project
    for all involved.

<h3>Avatar: The Way of Water (2022)</h3>

<p>This movie was created by the masterful director James Cameron. He took his
    time creating it
    because in his opinion, "The technology didn't exist yet to do what the film
    required." </p>

<p>This sequel to the 2009 film Avatar was incredibly filmed, a
    large
    part of it underwater in stunning HD with beautiful alien sea life. It was
    one of the most visually stunning movies I've ever seen.
</p>

<h3>The Bourne Trilogy (2002, 2004, & 2007)</h3>

<p>Yes, this is technically cheating as it's three movies, not one, but I
    couldn't pick only one from the series, so I'm naming it as one series.</p>
<p>This trilogy not only had pulse-pounding moment after moment, but was scored
    brilliantly by John Powell. My favorite thing about these films is Jason
    Bourne's intelligence, and how he's always a step ahead of the people
    tracking him.
    He's a brilliant mind, as well as an amazing martial artist.</p>

<p>He's the millenials' James Bond, without being overly
    flashy or relying on crazy gadgetry. One of my all-time favorite movie
    series. I re-watch it often!</p>
